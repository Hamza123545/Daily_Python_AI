**Number Guessing Game**






**Overview**





This is a simple Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to guess the number within 3 attempts. The program provides hints if the guessed number is too high or too low.






**How It Works**





The program generates a random number using Python's random.randint(1, 100) function.







The user is prompted to guess the number.






If the guess is higher than the generated number, the program suggests guessing a lower number.






If the guess is lower, the program suggests guessing a higher number.






The user has a maximum of 3 attempts to guess correctly.





If the user guesses correctly within the given attempts, they win.






If the user fails to guess correctly within 3 attempts, the program reveals the correct number.




How to Run the Program




Ensure you have Python installed on your system.




Copy the script into a .py file, for example, guess_game.py.




Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the file's location.





Run the script using the command:




    python guess_game.py



    

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.







**Example Output**

    Guess the number between 1 and 100! (Max attempts: 3)
    Enter your guess: 50
    Lower number please
    Enter your guess: 25
    Higher number please
    Enter your guess: 30
    Congratulations! You guessed the number 30 correctly in 3 attempts.

**OR**

    Guess the number between 1 and 100! (Max attempts: 3)
    Enter your guess: 80
    Lower number please
    Enter your guess: 40
    Higher number please
    Enter your guess: 50
    Sorry! You've used all 3 attempts. The correct number was 55.
